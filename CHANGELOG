~ The subscription form is now implemented with a Blade template and ONLY supports Bootstrap 3 markup
~ Updated PayPal payments plugin with forced TLSv1.2. You MUST use a compatible server!

~ Much better solution to remembering form information: Fields will contain saved information from your last subscription when you access the Level page *UNLESS* you have EXPLICITLY ended up there by submitting an invalid form.
~ Updated VAT rates
~ Adjustment for Joomla! 3.6 log dir change
~ Update TCPDF to the newest available v6 release

# [HIGH] Recurring subscriptions did not issue invoices
# [HIGH] ATS credits and the reseller plugin were referencing the obsolete FOF 2 instead of the correct FOF 3 classes
# [HIGH] The converted currency price didn't include VAT and signup fees even when the uncoverted price did
# [HIGH] Do not remove akeebabackup.com from the emails. It's breaking the emails we're sending from our own site...
# [HIGH] If someone blanked out their VAT number after using a VIES-registered VAT number no VAT was charged
# [HIGH] After submitting an invalid form the fields were filled with the saved user state parameters instead of the submitted user's data
# [HIGH] Cannot download invoice from the front-end
# [HIGH] "Run Integrations" didn't work
# [HIGH] An empty username is NOT acceptable
# [MEDIUM] Do not use recurring amount for the first initial payment
# [MEDIUM] Spooky error with the logout plugin and Joomla! 3.5+ session management
