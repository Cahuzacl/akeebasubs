Move this to get state

	Also provide the level object itself

Get rid of "new JDate", use $this->container->platform->getDate instead

$this->container->platform->getDate()->toUnix ==> time()  because, duh!
	WARNING: Do not just search for $this->container->platform->getDate(), we use ->toSql() as well!!!
